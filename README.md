Signal Processing Toolkit

This project performs various signal processing operations such as downsampling, upsampling, interpolation, decimation, and frequency analysis using Python.

Features

Downsampling vs. Decimation: Compares naive downsampling with proper decimation.

Upsampling vs. Interpolation: Analyzes zero-insertion upsampling and interpolation.

Resampling: Changes sampling rate using a rational factor.

Audio Processing: Reads and processes an audio file (sin.wav).

Frequency Analysis: Generates frequency response plots of processed signals.

Files Overview

main.py - Main script that executes the signal processing functions.

utils.py - Contains utility functions for signal generation, FFT, and plotting.

requirements.txt - Lists required Python dependencies.

sin.wav - Sample audio file for processing.

out/ - Stores generated output images.

Output

Generated frequency response plots and resampled signals are saved in the out/ directory.
